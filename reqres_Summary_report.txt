Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for reqres.in App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 103.86.197.3. 

50 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 5 And Total Concurrent API requested: 300.
100 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 10 And Total Concurrent API requested: 600.
115 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 11.5 And Total Concurrent API requested: 690.
120 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 12 And Total Concurrent API requested: 720.
123 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 12.3 And Total Concurrent API requested: 738.
125 Concurrent Request with 1 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 12 And Total Concurrent API requested: 750.

While executed 125 concurrent request, found  1 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.13%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 744 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries.
